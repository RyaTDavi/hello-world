# hello-world

My name is Ryan Davis. I have a music education degree and was fully licensed to teach music k-12 in the state of Tennessee. I ignored all that and chose to join the Army. After 
serving a 4 year actuve duty contract, I utilized my college benefits to obtain a computer science degree, which is what I am currently working on.
